## Introduction
This notebook is my attempt to reproduce the Minitab exercises from Unit 01 of the Open University statistics module M248, Analysing Data. Categorical data can be displayed with a bar chart, which R refers to as a barplot. The datasets used by M248 in this unit are tattoos.mwx and workforce.mwx respectively. The file 'tattoos.csv' contains raw data whereas the 'workforce.mwx' file contains tabularised data. R cannot directly import Minitab files so I have converted them to similarly named CSV files.

## Tattoos dataset
Let/s have a look at the structure of the tattoos dataset:
```{r str, echo=TRUE}
tats <- read.csv("tattoos.csv")
str(tats)
```

Now let's see the first 6 entries:
```{r head, echo=TRUE}
head(tats)
```

## Base Barchart
The variable "Score", which categorises the quality of surgical removal, will be displayed using a barchart but first we have to use the R function table() to build a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels, otherwise tats$Score will yield a Y-height on a scale of 1 to 4, with a column for each of the 55 cases. What we need instead is a count of cases with each score:
```{r score, echo=TRUE}
counts <- table(tats$Score)
counts
barplot(counts, 
        main = "Bar plot produced in base R", 
        xlab = "Quality of tattoo removal score", 
        ylab = "Frequency", 
        col = 0,                          # colour fill (e.g. col = "blue", or col = 0 [no colour])
        axis.lty = 1, 
        ylim = c(0,20), xpd = FALSE)      # (xpd = FALSE) clips the plot to the plotting region
axis(1, at = c(0,5),pos=0)                # this is a workaround to produce the x-axis
```

## Ggplot2 Barchart
```{r ggbar-simple, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(tats, aes(Score)) +
geom_bar()
p
```

So, creating a basic barchart is much easier with ggplot2. If you use geom_bar, the default stat is 'count' and so the first argument is just the dataframe, 'tats', and the factor to be counted is 'Score'. Simples. We can now just tart it up to mimic the minitab output.

```{r ggbar-tartedup, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(tats, aes(Score)) +
geom_bar(width = 0.75, colour="black", fill="white") +
theme_bw() +
  labs(
       title="Bar chart produced in Ggplot2",     # subtitle="whatever", caption = "whatever",
       y="Frequency",
       x="Quality of tattoo removal score" 
       ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 4.5), expand = c(0, 0)) +         # expand = c(0, 0) removes default
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 20), expand = c(0, 0)) +          # gap between axis and (0, 0)
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_line(colour = "white")
  )
p
```

## Workforce dataset
Let/s have a look at the structure of the tattoos dataset:
```{r str-workforce, echo=TRUE}
workers <- read.csv("workforce.csv")
str(workers)
```

The dataset is small enough to view all entries:
```{r head-workforce, echo=TRUE}
workers
```

I admit defeat for now. I need to rest on it. I must admit I can't see how to make a barchart from data that has already been aggregated.
