# M248R
I have started studying M248 (Analysing data) with the Open University. I am doing it for fun, and to keep an ageing brain exercised so, when I am no longer an OU student, I won't be able to afford proprietary software licences so this is my attempt to learn R, Rmarkdown, and how to use GitHub.
It is all a bit mysterious at the moment.
