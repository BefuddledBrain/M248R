The proportion of Scottish soldiers who had chests measuring between 37 and 42 inches inclusive is 
`r pnorm(42, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE) - pnorm(37, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE)`.

The proportion of Scottish soldiers whose chest measurements were greater than 43 inches is 
`r pnorm(43, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = FALSE)`.

Only 2.5% of Scottish soldiers had a chest measurement below `r sprintf("%.1f", qnorm(0.025, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE))` inches.

Only 5% of Scottish soldiers had a chest measurement above `r sprintf("%.1f", qnorm(0.95, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE))` inches.

The proportion of Scottish soldiers had chest measurements more than three standard deviations from the mean, that is, below 34 or above 46 is:
\begin{align*}
  P(X \le 34 + P(X > 46)
    &=  F(34) + (1 - F(46))  \\
    &=  `r pnorm(34, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE)`
                              \text{ + (1 - }`r pnorm(46, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE)` \text{)} \\
    &= `r pnorm(34, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE)`
                              \text{ + } `r (pnorm(46, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = FALSE))` \\
    &= `r pnorm(34, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE) + (1 - pnorm(46, mean = 40, sd = 2, lower.tail = TRUE))`
\end{align*}

For a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2.75 was used to model errors in angular measurements.
According to the model, the proportion of errors are more than three standard deviations from the mean is 
`r 2 * pnorm(0 - 3 * sqrt(2.75), mean = 0, sd = sqrt(2.75))`

OK, we get the message -- \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) are irrelevant.
